Download slate.html and load in your html5 web browser.

All you need, including the audio is contained in the single html file -- so it will work in places where you don't have network connectivity.

I'm hoping this works with tablets -- not tested yet but it should.

data_uri = open("censor-beep-1.wav", "rb").read().encode("base64").replace("\n", "")
print "data:audio/wave;base64,",
print data_uri
